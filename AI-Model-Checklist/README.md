# AI Model Lifecycle Quality Checklist

This folder contains structured quality control checklists created based on my experience supporting AI/ML components in IVD systems during my role at AstraZeneca. These templates reflect essential checkpoints used to ensure regulatory and quality compliance for machine learning models used in highly regulated environments like pharma and diagnostics.

Each checklist corresponds to a distinct phase in the AI model lifecycle:

- Data Collection  
- Preprocessing  
- Model Training  
- Stage-wise Documentation  
- Risk Mitigation Planning  

The checklists are available both in Markdown format and as a consolidated Excel sheet for operational use and audit readiness.

> âœ… These templates aim to support traceability, consistency, and quality assurance across ML model development and deployment stages.
